## What it does
It was designed to alert you when your friends were at nearby public events.

## How I built it
We designed the GUI in Balsamiq

## Challenges I ran into
Had issues coding it, but learned about Android Studio and how to utilize Google Maps API
While we couldn't code our original idea, we made an app that begins to make a cut through the city.
